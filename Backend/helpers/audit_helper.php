/**
 * eDESK Print & Digital - Activity / Audit Log helper
 *
 * Records who did what, and when, for the actions that matter if
 * something goes wrong later: deleting a sale, changing a price,
 * removing a user, adjusting stock through a damage entry, etc.
 *
 * Design notes (read before changing this):
 *  - The actor's name and role are stored as plain text on the log row
 *    itself (user_name, user_role), NOT only as a foreign key to
 *    `users`. This is deliberate, not duplication for its own sake: if
 *    that user's account is later deleted, the log must still say who
 *    did it. user_id is kept too (nullable, no FK) so the two pieces
 *    of information - "who, right now" and "who, historically" - both
 *    survive independently.
 *  - Logging never throws and never blocks the real operation. A
 *    failed audit write should not stop a sale from being recorded.
 *  - Only mutations are logged (create/update/delete/payment) - never
 *    GET/list requests. Logging every page view would drown the
 *    handful of entries that actually matter under noise.
